Abstract
Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring
a model’s CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However,
the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing mod-
els’ actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art
reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1)
for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1%
of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2)
outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus
without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently
hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase,
even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT mon-
itoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and
evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in
settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of
CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) can reason through chain-of-thought (CoT) before responding to
users. Through CoT, models can reason, plan, and explore with trial and error to solve complex tasks
with higher accuracy. This CoT ability has been further enhanced in the recent surge of reasoning
models such as OpenAI o1/o3 (OpenAI et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025), DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek-AI
et al., 2025a), Gemini Flash Thinking (DeepMind, 2025) and Claude 3.7 Sonnet Extended Thinking
(Anthropic, 2025). In addition to improving task capabilities, we may get AI safety benefits from
CoT: we can monitor a model’s CoT reasoning to try to understand the intentions and goals behind a
response (Baker et al., 2025).
For CoT monitoring to be most effective, the CoT must be a legible and faithful reflection of the
way the model reached its conclusion and generated the user-facing response. This means that the
model’s CoT must be understandable by humans (Kirchner et al., 2024) and highlight the key factors
and steps behind its reasoning (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020; Turpin et al., 2023;
Chen et al., 2024). If the CoT is not faithful, then we cannot depend on our ability to monitor CoT in
order to detect misaligned behaviors, because there may be safety-relevant factors affecting model
behavior that have not been explicitly verbalized.

Figure 1: CoT faithfulness scores of reasoning models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1)
compared to non-reasoning models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) and DeepSeek V3). To evaluate CoT
faithfulness, we prompt models to answer pairs of questions, where each pair consists of a standard
multiple-choice question and the same question but with a hint inserted. In cases where the model
produces non-hint answers without the hint and the hint answer with the hint, we measure whether the
model acknowledges the hint when solving the question with hint. Different bars show faithfulness
results on different types of hints.
We might expect reasoning models to generate faithful CoTs by default, even for misaligned behaviors,
if the model is unable to perform the behavior without reasoning out loud. Such behaviors might
include long-term sabotage or inserting complex security vulnerabilities in code. Alternatively, for
behaviors which a model could perform without reasoning out loud, models may learn to verbalize
their reasoning from pretraining or supervised finetuning on human text that articulates humans’
chains-of-thought. On the other hand, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) could
incentivize models to hide undesirable reasoning from their CoT (Ouyang et al., 2022; Chua and
Evans, 2025). Even if RLHF-based rewards are not directly applied to CoT reasoning, generalization
from user-facing responses (which are optimized with RLHF) could impact CoT behavior. Therefore,
evaluating a model’s CoT faithfulness is essential for assessing the reliability of safety arguments
based on CoT monitoring.
We evaluate the CoT faithfulness of two state-of-the-art reasoning models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet and
DeepSeek R1)1across 6 kinds of reasoning hints presented in the prompts (Turpin et al., 2023; Chua
and Evans, 2025) (Section 3). Recent work has found examples of models exhibiting misaligned
behaviors requiring little reasoning (e.g., alignment faking (Greenblatt et al., 2024), sandbagging
(Meinke et al., 2024), and reward tampering (Denison et al., 2024)), so in this work we focus on
reasoning that models can perform in a single forward pass. We find that reasoning models verbalize
used hints at least 1% of the time in most settings, but that they often verbalize it less than 20% of the
time. We also find that CoTs are less faithful on harder tasks.
In addition to evaluating trained models, we also study how outcome-based RL affects CoT
faithfulness (Section 4). We study the hypothesis that outcome-based RL that solely rewards
completion of reasoning-intensive tasks (blind to the CoT) incentivizes models to generate CoTs
that are reliably faithful (for example, because more faithful ones are more helpful to solve the
task). Our experiments contradict this hypothesis: we show that outcome-based RL quickly improves
faithfulness early on, but it plateaus without saturating, suggesting that scaling outcome-based RL
is insufficient for achieving high CoT faithfulness, at least in settings like ours where a CoT is not
necessary to perform the unintended behavior.
1We don’t study the o1 or o3 reasoning models in this paper because we don’t have access to their CoT and
thus can’t evaluate their faithfulness.

Figure 2: An example of an unfaithful CoT generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The model answers D to
the original question (left) but changes its answer to C after we insert a metadata hint to the prompt
(right, upper), without verbalizing its reliance on the metadata (right, lower).
We then study a concrete training-time application of CoT monitoring: detecting reward hacks
during RL (Everitt et al., 2021; Krakovna et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2022; Denison et al., 2024) (Section
5). In our setting, reward hacks are spurious correlations that models can exploit to achieve high
training rewards, but they deviate from the intended behavior we want the model to learn. For
example, Claude 3.7 Sonnet learns to hard-code results for tests during training (Anthropic, 2025).
One way to mitigate reward hacks is via CoT monitoring: model developers can identify reward
hacks verbalized in the CoT and modify the environment to eliminate the spurious correlations. Do
CoTs reliably verbalize a model’s reward hacking behavior during RL? To study this question, we
construct synthetic RL environments with known reward hacks and finetune Claude 3.7 Sonnet on
them. The model fully learns the reward hacks (reward > 0.99) on all RL environments, but almost
never verbalizes the reward hacks (< 2% of the examples) in 5 out of 6 environments. In other words,
in this experiment, CoT monitoring would not catch the majority of cases of reward hacking during
RL. This result is more negative than recent results in Baker et al. (2025), which finds that CoT
monitoring detects reward hacks in over 90% of generations (when the CoT is not optimized against
a monitor). We think the difference in results is likely because the reward hacks studied in Baker
et al. (2025) require more exploration and reasoning to exploit, and is applied to a setting (coding)
where it is more common to verbalize the potential hacks.
In conclusion, our results show that:
1.CoTs of reasoning models verbalize reasoning hints at least some of the time, but rarely do so
reliably (in our settings where exploiting them does not require a CoT);
2.Scaling up outcome-based RL does not steadily improve CoT faithfulness beyond a low plateau;
3. CoT monitoring may not reliably catch reward hacking during RL.
These results suggest that:
1.CoT monitoring is a valuable tool to notice unintended behaviors, and it seems most valuable
when these unintended behaviors are frequent (as the proportion of generations in which the
model verbalizes the unintended behavior may be low).
3
2.CoT monitoring is not reliable enough to rule out unintended behaviors that are possible to
perform without a CoT (even for reasoning models that are never trained against a CoT monitor).
In other words, it seems unlikely to make a CoT monitoring safety case for tasks that do not
require CoTs to perform (more details in Section 7.1).
2 Measuring CoT Faithfulness
Given an input x, a model Mautoregressively generates a CoT cfollowed by an answer a.x,c
andaare all text in this paper, but can be extended to be multimodal. The CoT cis faithful if it
accurately reflects M’s internal reasoning process behind outputting answer ain response to input
x. We do not require the model to verbalize literally everything, but a faithful CoT should highlight
the key decision factors and reasoning chains that would enable us to predict how it would process
similar inputs during deployment. For example, if a sycophantic model bases its prediction on a
user’s suggestion, it should verbalize sycophancy.
2.1 Metric
Evaluating CoT faithfulness is challenging, as it requires comparing the CoT to the model’s internal
reasoning, which is a priori hard or impossible to determine. Inspired by Turpin et al. (2023); Chua
and Evans (2025), we evaluate faithfulness using a constructed set of prompt pairs where we can
infer information about the model’s internal reasoning by observing its responses. Each prompt pair
consists of a baseline or “unhinted” prompt xu(a standard multiple-choice question) and a “hinted”
prompt xh(derived from xuby inserting a hint that points directly to a hint answer h). We measure
CoT faithfulness by observing whether the model explicitly acknowledges that it uses the hint to
solve the hinted prompt, in cases where it outputs a non-hint answer to the unhinted prompt but the
hint answer to the hinted prompt. Specifically, we prompt the model separately with xuandxhto
obtain its chains-of-thought cand answers a:
(cu, au) =M(xu); (ch, ah) =M(xh).
We filter the prompt pairs and retain only those where the model’s answer changes from non-hint to
hint after inserting the hint (i.e., au̸=handah=h). Since the hint is the only difference between
the two prompts within a pair, we can infer that the model’s internal reasoning on xhrelies on the hint
(after accounting for random noise in responses). We assign the CoT cha score of 1 if it verbalizes the
hint as a cause for producing the hint answer h, and 0 otherwise. We then average the verbalization
scores across all retained prompt pairs as the model’s faithfulness score:
CoT faithfulness score (M) =E[1[chverbalizes the hint h]|au̸=h, a h=h].
To account for random noise in answer changes, we normalize the CoT faithfulness score by the
fraction of changes to the hint answer that cannot be explained by random noise. Let pdenote
the probability of changing from a non-hint answer to the hint answer: p=P(ah=h|au̸=h)).
Letqdenote the probability of changing from a non-hint answer to a different non-hint answer
(with n−2possibilities for the new answer, as it cannot be the hint or the original answer):
q=P(ah̸=h, a h̸=au|au̸=h). A random model would output each option with equal probability,
soα= (p−q/(n−2))/p= 1−q/(n−2)prepresents the proportion of changes to the hint answer
that cannot be explained by randomness. We normalize the CoT faithfulness score by dividing by
this coefficient, and clip the maximum at 1:
normalized CoT faithfulness score (M) = min {CoT faithfulness score /(1−q/(n−2)p),1}.
Ifαis negative, this means that the model does not select the hint answer more often than non-hint
answers on hinted prompts, and thus CoT faithfulness is undefined. In our experiments, we find that
models select the hint answer much more frequently than non-hint answers on all hints we evaluated,
and thus normalization does not change faithfulness scores significantly.
Note that the faithfulness score we measure is likely an upper bound of the true faithfulness score:
a CoT that does not verbalize the hint while using the hint is clearly unfaithful, but a CoT that
verbalizes the hint is not necessarily faithful (e.g., the model might be using the hint for important
hidden intentions that it does not verbalize). In general, it seems hard to get an exact estimate of CoT
faithfulness without solving interpretability.

2.2 Data
We use multiple-choice questions from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GPQA (Rein et al.,
2024) to construct our prompt pairs.
We measure CoT faithfulness on 6 hints: 4 neutral hints (sycophancy, consistency, visual pattern,
and metadata) and 2 misaligned hints (grader hacking and using unethically-obtained information).
Exploiting the misaligned hints may lead to concerning outcomes, so CoT faithfulness on these hints
is particularly important for safety monitoring.
For evaluation robustness, we implement multiple variants for each hint and average the faithfulness
scores across the variants. Table 1 presents detailed information about each hint, including the form
in which the hint answer is provided and an example for each.
2.3 Experimental Setup
Eliciting CoTs . We prompt the model to think step-by-step to explain its reasoning and then write
the final option letter. For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, we use its scratchpad mode and specify a max thinking
length of 10k tokens. For all evaluations, we sample with temperature 0.
Evaluating CoTs . Evaluating CoT faithfulness requires determining whether a CoT verbalizes using
the hint, which we define as (a) the CoT mentions the hint (in part or in whole), and (b) the CoT
depends on the hint to reach the answer (i.e., the CoT likely would not have reached the hint answer
without the hint). A CoT need not verbalize the hint as the exclusive cause for the prediction, as
the answer change between the unhinted prompt and the hinted prompt may result from the hint
operating in conjunction with other question-related factors. However, we do not consider CoTs that

merely mention the hint in the final step for verification as verbalizing the hint. We prompt Claude 3.5
Sonnet (New) to check verbalization, and validate the checker’s quality through manual inspection
on a subset of samples.
3 Benchmarking CoT Faithfulness of Reasoning Models
We evaluate CoT faithfulness of two reasoning models: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2025) and
DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a), and compare them to two non-reasoning models: Claude
3.5 Sonnet (New) (Anthropic, 2024) and DeepSeek V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025b).
All evaluated models consistently use the hints. Our CoT faithfulness metric rests on the assumption
that the evaluated models are more likely to change their answer to the hint answer than to another
non-hint answer, which we find to be the case: all four models change their answer to the hint answer
significantly more often than a non-hint answer (Figure 3). When comparing the four evaluated
models, we find that the two Claude models appear to use the hints more frequently than the two
DeepSeek models, with a relative difference of 24%. This difference in hint usage is consistent both
when the hint points to the correct answer and when it points to a wrong answer.
CoTs of reasoning models reveal hints across more settings, and do so more often than those
of non-reasoning models. Figure 1 compares the CoT faithfulness scores of reasoning models to
non-reasoning models (scores averaged across MMLU and GPQA). Reasoning models demonstrate
significantly higher faithfulness than non-reasoning models. Deepseek R1 verbalizes the hints it uses
at least 1% of the time in 6/6 settings (vs 5/6 for Deepseek v3), and Claude 3.7 Sonnet verbalizes
the hints it uses at least 1% of the time in 5/6 settings (vs 4/6 for Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The average
faithfulness is 3.6 ×higher for the Claude series and 1.7 ×higher for the DeepSeek series.
CoTs of reasoning models often lack faithfulness and can conceal misalignment. The overall
faithfulness scores for both reasoning models remain low (25% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and 39% for
DeepSeek R1) (Figure 1). Particularly concerning are the low faithfulness scores on misalignment
hints (20% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and 29% for DeepSeek R1), which suggest that CoTs may hide
problematic reasoning processes.
CoT unfaithfulness is negatively correlated with brevity. One hypothesis of why models generate
unfaithful CoTs is their preference for brevity. Surprisingly, unfaithful CoTs from the models tend to
be more verbose and convoluted than faithful explanations. For Claude 3.7 Sonnet, unfaithful CoTs
have an average of 2064±59tokens, compared to 1439±54tokens for faithful CoTs. Similarly,
for DeepSeek R1, unfaithful CoTs have 6003±74tokens on average, while faithful CoTs are on

and GPQA (harder). Error bars show standard errors of the mean. CoTs on GPQA are consistently

DeepSeek R1. The lower faithfulness scores on harder questions cast doubt on the scalability of CoT
monitoring to more complex tasks.
average shorter with 4737±79tokens. Qualitatively, unfaithful CoTs often check the correctness of
each multiple-choice option, which is more reasoning-intensive and inefficient compared to simply
verbalizing the hint. See Figure 2 for one such example. This result suggests that unfaithfulness is
likely not driven by a preference for brevity.
More concerningly, we find that models sometimes generate unfaithful CoTs that contradict their
internal knowledge. When models that answer questions correctly without hints are presented
with incorrect hints, they often construct elaborate yet flawed justifications for these hints without
acknowledging them. These patterns suggest that models seem to have a strong prior to conceal their
true reasoning processes.
CoT appears to be less faithful on harder questions. Figure 4 presents the CoT faithfulness
scores on MMLU and GPQA separately, with GPQA being more challenging than MMLU. We
observe that CoTs on GPQA are consistently less faithful than those on MMLU across 5 out of 6 bias
categories (the other being a tie of 0% faithfulness) for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and all 6 categories for
DeepSeek R1, with an average relative decrease of 44% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and 32% for DeepSeek
R1. Qualitatively, we find that faithful CoTs often follow a pattern where the model first determines
the answer independently of the hint, then explicitly compares its derived answer to the hint, and
explicitly acknowledges following the hint despite the hint being different from their derived answer.
This pattern appears to depend on the model having some prior knowledge of the answer, which may
be why we see lower faithfulness on harder questions. Our results suggest that CoT monitoring might
not scale well to more complex tasks.
4 The Impact of Outcome-Based Reinforcement Learning on CoT
Faithfulness
In Section 3, we observe that unfaithful CoTs are rarely load-bearing and seldom help models arrive
at their responses (e.g., Figure 2). Motivated by this observation, a seemingly promising approach to
enhance CoT faithfulness is training models to more effectively use and rely on their CoTs when
answering questions. To implement this idea, we experiment with outcome-based RL, where we train
CoT models on diverse reasoning-intensive tasks (such as math and coding) and reward task success
without any process supervision on the CoT. We hypothesize that the reasoning demands of complex
7
Figure 5: CoT faithfulness scores with outcome-based RL. Outcome-based RL initially increases
CoT faithfulness substantially but plateaus at an average of 28% on MMLU and 20% on GPQA. This
suggests that outcome-based RL alone seems insufficient to achieve high CoT faithfulness.
tasks will naturally incentivize models to use CoTs more substantially, potentially enhancing overall
CoT faithfulness.
We RL an earlier snapshot of Claude 3.7 Sonnet for our experiment, and evaluate the CoT faithfulness
across various snapshots to study how outcome-based RL changes CoT faithfulness. Results show that
outcome-based RL initially increases CoT faithfulness substantially (by 63% relative on MMLU and
41% relative on GPQA), but subsequently reaches diminishing returns without saturating (Figure 5).
Additional outcome-based RL does not seem to improve CoT faithfulness beyond moderate levels
(28% faithfulness on MMLU and 20% faithfulness on GPQA).
5 CoT Faithfulness on RL Reward Hacks
Recent research has found that scaling up RL significantly improves model capabilities, particularly
on reasoning-intensive tasks such as math and coding (OpenAI et al., 2024). However, a substantial
open challenge in RL is reward hacking, where models learn spurious correlations that yield high
rewards during training but do not generalize to test examples (Everitt et al., 2021; Krakovna et al.,
2020; Pan et al., 2022; Denison et al., 2024). Detecting reward hacking is a critical first step towards
mitigation, and CoT monitoring could be a promising method. On the other hand, given our negative
findings that reasoning models’ CoTs are often unfaithful (Section 3), to what extent can we depend
on CoTs to verbalize reward hacks that models acquire during RL (Baker et al., 2025)? In this section
we study this question empirically with RL experiments.
5.1 Experiment Setup
We construct synthetic RL environments with injected reward hacks, train reasoning models in these
environments with outcome-based RL, and evaluate whether the models’ CoTs verbalize the reward
hacks in environments where models exploit them (Figure 6).
Data. We repurpose the hints from Section 2.2 as reward hacks, using the hinted prompts as our RL
training data. We create 6 distinct RL environments, one for each hint type. All training data are

must exploit the reward hacks in order to achieve high rewards.
Reward. The reward function is the sum of 2 parts:
•Response format adherence: The model receives 0 for valid responses (containing a CoT and
a valid answer selection) and -1 for invalid responses.
•Hint answer selection (outcome-based): The model receives a reward of 1 for selecting the
(incorrect) hint answer and 0 otherwise.
Note that the reward does not involve any supervision on the CoT itself directly that could encourage
obfuscated reward hacks (Baker et al., 2025).

5.2 Results
Results show that models rapidly learn to exploit reward hacks on all 6 RL environments, and select
the incorrect hint answer on >99% of the examples within 30 steps. However, this reward hacking
occurs without corresponding verbalization—in 5 out of 6 environments, the CoTs verbalize the

examples. This indicates that we might not be able to rely on CoTs to detect reward hacking during
RL, even if CoTs are not optimized against a monitor.
reward hacks on fewer than 2% of examples (Figure 7). Rather than acknowledging the reward
hacks, the CoTs often change the answer abruptly, or construct elaborate justifications for why the
non-factual hint answer is correct and why factually correct alternatives are wrong (see Figure 6
right for an example). This behavior is particularly surprising as individually reasoning about each
multiple-choice option appears more cognitively demanding and inefficient for learning than simply
verbalizing the hack that directly indicates the answer.
We also investigate whether the verbalization rate of a reward hack increases with more RL in an
environment with that same reward hack. Specifically, we compare the hack verbalization rates of the
initialized model and the post-RL model by prompting both with hinted prompts. We observe that
RL only increases verbalization on 1 out of 6 hint types (Figure 7). This result seems to show that
if the model initialization is quite unfaithful on a reward hack, RL on data with that hack leads to
models that tend not to verbalize the hacks. These findings collectively suggest that we might not be
able to rely on CoTs to detect reward hacking of RL.
6 Related Work
Evaluating CoTs. Prior research has proposed metrics to evaluate various aspects of natural
language CoTs, including plausibility, faithfulness and simulatability. Plausibility evaluates the
factual correctness of a CoT and how convincingly it justifies the model’s response (Herman, 2017;
Lage et al., 2019; Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020). Different from plausibility, faithfulness evaluates
whether the CoT accurately reveals the model’s internal reasoning process behind responding to an
input (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Gilpin et al., 2018; Wu and Mooney, 2019; Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020;
Lanham et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023). Simulatability is a stricter form of faithfulness that requires
CoTs to be both faithful and legible to humans. It measures whether humans can build precise and
generalizable mental models of how the model processes various inputs through observing its CoTs
(Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017; Chandrasekaran et al., 2018; Hase and Bansal, 2020; Chen et al., 2024).
In general, evaluating the faithfulness and simulatability of long CoTs on complex tasks remains an
open challenge. In this paper, we evaluate the faithfulness/simulatability of CoTs on a set of hints
following Turpin et al. (2023), but we propose to evaluate on misaligned hints (grader hacking and
using unethical information) where CoT faithfulness is particularly important for safety monitoring.
Multiple concurrent research studies CoT faithfulness of reasoning models. Chua and Evans (2025)
evaluates the CoT faithfulness of reasoning models and finds them to be more faithful than non-
reasoning models but still far from being perfectly faithful, which is consistent with our findings. In
10
addition, we find that CoTs are not reliably faithful even on misaligned hints, which casts doubt on
the reliability of CoT monitoring. Arcuschin et al. (2025) also finds CoTs of reasoning models to be
unfaithful, and studies two specific kinds of unfaithfulness: restoration errors (models silently correct
their errors without verbalization) and unfaithful shortcuts (models use illogical reasoning without
verbalization). Baker et al. (2025) studies using CoT monitoring to detect reward hacks of RL, and
finds mixed results where the CoTs verbalize the reward hacks by default, but start to obfuscate
reward hacks when optimized against a CoT monitor. We also study this question in Section 5, but
our findings are more negative and suggest that CoTs may obfuscate reward hacks even without
optimization pressure against a monitor. We hypothesize that CoTs in Baker et al. (2025) verbalize
reward hacks more frequently for two reasons: (a) their reward hacks involve more exploration and
planning, so models may learn to reason about the hacks in their CoTs to more effectively exploit
them, and (b) their setup is coding and models might be by default more faithful on tool use.
Generating and Improving CoTs. Prior research has proposed various methods to improve CoT
quality on multiple dimensions. To improve faithfulness, researchers have developed test-time
methods using question decomposition (Radhakrishnan et al., 2023), symbolic reasoning (Lyu et al.,
2023), and causal mediation analysis on counterfactuals (Paul et al., 2024). To improve simulatability
and consistency, prior work has trained models to generate CoTs that are consistent on semantically
related inputs (Akyürek et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025) and robust to various biases (Chua et al., 2024).
To improve reasoning capabilities, prior work has proposed test-time methods such as contrastive
prompting with correct and wrong CoTs (Chia et al., 2023) and self-consistency ensembling (Huang
et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), as well as train-time methods that use iterative optimization guided by
reasoning outcomes or verifier models (Pang et al., 2024). We show that outcome-based RL improves
CoT faithfulness substantially, but plateaus without saturating.
7 Discussion
7.1 Implications for Test-time CoT Monitoring Safety Cases
Safety cases are structured arguments that AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe (Clymer
et al., 2024). On the positive side, our results show that CoTs of reasoning model are faithful on at
least some examples on most hints. This suggests that CoT monitoring can be useful at detecting
some malicious behaviors during training and evaluations, particularly threats that are frequent or
require multiple actions, which increases the chance of at least one threat/action being verbalized
in the CoT. However, for rarer threats that don’t require multiple actions (e.g., self-exfiltration), our
findings of low faithfulness suggest that CoT monitoring may be less effective.
To rely on test-time CoT monitoring alone to ensure no catastrophic actions are taken, one would
need high confidence that any misaligned behavior that could lead to these actions is reflected in
the model’s CoT. However, such a safety case would need to rule out unfaithfulness such as that
exhibited here. Our results indicate that this would require either algorithmic innovation that makes
CoTs substantially more faithful (other than just more RL training), alternative arguments that CoTs
will be more faithful for realistic threats, or supporting evidence from other safety measures that can
rule out bad behavior in settings where CoT is unfaithful.
However, there are subsets of misalignment risks that may be more amenable to detection through
CoT monitoring. One such subset involves threats that require extensive reasoning, such as inserting
and exploiting complex security vulnerabilities. Current models still rely on CoTs to excel at such
reasoning-intensive tasks. Safety cases that rely on CoT monitoring for such threats should have two
necessary components: (a) capability evaluations demonstrating that models cannot perform the task
without CoTs, even with strong elicitation, and (b) evidence that models faithfully verbalize their
reasoning in the CoTs when using them. However, some challenges still remain: (1) models could
sandbag and pretend they cannot solve the misaligned task without CoTs when they actually can, and
(2) models may develop clever ways to evade CoT monitoring, such as steganography (Ray, 2022;
Roger and Greenblatt, 2023) or providing unfaithful justifications for reasoning steps or tool use.
Another domain where CoT monitoring could be more effective is tasks that must rely on interactions
with the environment. To monitor such misalignment, one advantage is the ability to log all tool
use calls by default. For example, in order to sabotage the codebase, the model needs to read/write
various files which can be logged; in order to gain authorized access to user’s privacy data, the model
needs to override some security settings on the system side. However, the risk remains that models
11
might develop effective ways to evade CoT monitoring by providing fake and unfaithful justifications
for their tool use calls. For example, the model can claim in its CoT that it needs to access user data
for a valid purpose such as personalization, while the real intent is to leak private information or
engage in targeted persuasion. Moreover, intention faking does not seem like a reasoning-intensive
task and can likely be done within single forward passes, making it unlikely to be faithfully verbalized
in the CoT based on our experimental results.
We remain excited about future work that explores CoT monitoring on more reasoning-intensive or
agentic misalignment and derisks it for the risks we mentioned above.
7.2 Limitations of Our Settings
Our settings have some important differences with more realistic settings where CoT monitoring
might be used. First, our settings are variations on the sort of multiple-choice questions frequently
used in benchmarks and exams, which usually expect reasoning that is about the question: during
training most exam questions are followed by an explanation that is purely about the content, and
that does not mention potential circumstantial hints. Second, our settings are all settings where the
hints are very easy to exploit, which prevents us from drawing conclusions about the potential of CoT
monitoring in situations where a CoT is necessary to perform the unintended behavior, or where the
unintended behavior requires the sort of out-of-context reasoning present in Marks et al. (2025).
8 Conclusion
We empirically study the CoT faithfulness of reasoning models and find that CoT monitoring is a
promising approach to noticing unintended behaviors, but that it is not reliable enough to rule out
unintended behaviors. Our findings are limited in a variety of ways, as they focus on unintended
behaviors for which a CoT is not necessary, and only study a particular kind of unintended behavior
(using hints to answer a multiple-choice question). We are excited for further work on this area, as
CoT monitoring could potentially be a powerful ingredient in alignment. Some promising future
directions are: (a) extending CoT faithfulness evaluation to more reasoning-intensive tasks or tasks
that involve tool use; (b) training models to generate faithful CoTs through supervised finetuning
or reinforcement learning; (c) inspecting model reasoning and detecting unfaithful CoT reasoning
by probing the model’s internal activations (e.g., activated sparse autoencoder features or activated
circuits).
